jdk download
in ur machine --> u will be having jvm --> irrespective of os 
hardware top of that os top of that jvm(without jvm we can't run java file)
java is platform independent --> you can run your application on any machine
irrespective of hardware or Os
ur application is independent , but jvm is dependent --> jvm is need to be built for particular OS
code --> compiler --> byte code --> goes on --> run on jvm 
the first file need to have main method . the execution starts from the first file
main has provide particular signature --> public static void main*(String a[])
javac Hello.java -> compile
java Hello --> run
u need extra libraries , and the environment(jre)
jvm is the part of the jre
jdk --> jre--> jvm
if u want to run ur application in ur friends machine --> jre and jvm are installed
---> variable 
      Temporary storage
      data must be numeric,text,Image

Data type -- Primitive -- Integer - byte,short,int,long
                       -- Float -- double,float
                       -- character 
                       --Boolean --> True/False

int --> 4 bytes --> (-231) to (231-1)
long --> 8 bytes --> -263 to 263-1
short --> 2 bytes  --> -215 to 215 -1
byte --> 1 byte  --> -128 to 127

double num = 5.6;
float num = 5.6f;

char -> 2 bytes
char c = 'k';

boolean --> true or false
(0,1) does not work

boolean b = true

--->Type conversion and casting

byte b = 127;
int a = 256;
wrong --> b = a;
correct --> a = b;

Type casting
b = (byte)a; --> ur converting integer to byte format
float f = 5.6f;
int x = (int)f;

Type promotion
byte a = 10;
byte b = 30;
int result = a*b;

What kind of error will be thrown if the main method is not found in the Java program? Run time error
Which of the following is the valid way to represent a long literal in Java?
123L,123l,0b1010L
What is the default value assigned to a variable of boolean type? false
What does a high-order bit represent for an integer? sign of the integer

logical operators 

& - AND 
| - OR
!- Not

In terms of reading files,data base and networks --> while loop make sense
In terms of frequency for loop make sense
Which conditional statement is used to check multiple possible values of a variable? switch
